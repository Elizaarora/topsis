TOPSIS: Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis SuiteAn all-in-one toolkit designed to execute the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). This project bridges the gap between data science and accessibility by offering both a high-performance Python CLI and a zero-install, browser-based web application.📝 DescriptionTOPSIS is a mathematical framework used to rank various alternatives based on multiple, often conflicting, criteria. It identifies the "best" choice by finding the alternative with the shortest geometric distance from the Positive Ideal Solution (PIS) and the longest distance from the Negative Ideal Solution (NIS).This repository features:Python CLI Engine (topsis.py): Optimized for automation and large-scale batch processing.Web-Based Interface (index.html): A sleek, client-side dashboard for instant interactive analysis.🖥️ Command-Line ToolRequirementsPython 3.xpandas, numpy (Core data processing)openpyxl (Excel integration)InstallationSet up your environment by installing the necessary libraries via pip:Bashpip install pandas numpy openpyxl
UsageRun the script from your terminal using the following syntax:Bashpython topsis.py <InputDataFile> <Weights> <Impacts> <OutputResultFileName>
ParametersInputDataFile: Path to your source data (supports .csv or .xlsx).Weights: Importance of each criterion, separated by commas (e.g., "1,1,2,1").Impacts: Direction of the criteria. Use + for "more is better" (e.g., Profit) and - for "less is better" (e.g., Cost) (e.g., "+,+,-,+").OutputResultFileName: The destination filename for your results.Input File FormatYour dataset must include a header row and follow these rules:Column 1: Unique names or IDs for your alternatives.Columns 2+: Numerical values representing your criteria.AlternativeCost (-)Quality (+)Speed (+)Risk (-)Device A5008102Device B7009121Device C400684Note: The input file must contain at least 3 columns (1 for identifiers + at least 2 criteria).ExampleTo process a file named comparison.xlsx with equal weighting:Bashpython topsis.py comparison.xlsx "1,1,1,1" "-,+,+,-" final_rankings.xlsx
OutputThe resulting file will append two critical columns to your original data:Topsis Score: A decimal between 0 and 1 (closer to 1 is superior).Rank: An integer indicating the priority (1 being the top choice).🌐 Web ServiceA lightweight, modern web portal for users who prefer a visual interface. Since it uses client-side JavaScript, your data never leaves your computer, ensuring total privacy.Web Service Features✅ Zero Backend: Runs entirely in the browser using JS—no server installation required.✅ Drag-and-Drop: Effortlessly upload files via a modern UI drop zone.✅ Live Preview: Inspect your data table instantly before running the algorithm.✅ Visual Analytics: Interactive result tables with color-coded rank badges (Gold, Silver, Bronze).✅ Direct Delivery: Integrated EmailJS support to send results directly to your inbox.✅ Responsive Design: Fully functional on desktops, tablets, and mobile browsers.Web Service UsageLaunch index.html in any modern web browser.Upload: Drop your CSV or XLSX file into the upload area.Configure: Enter your weights (e.g., 1,0.5,2) and impacts (e.g., +,-,+).Email: Provide an email address for a digital copy of the report.Execute: Click "Process TOPSIS Analysis" to generate the ranking and trigger the download.Email Setup (Web Service)The app leverages EmailJS. To activate this feature:Sign up at EmailJS.Connect an email service and create a template.In index.html, replace the placeholder Public Key, Service ID, and Template ID with your own credentials.📊 How TOPSIS WorksThe algorithm follows a rigorous 6-step mathematical journey:Normalization: Converts different units (like dollars vs. percentages) into a comparable scale.$$r_{ij} = \frac{x_{ij}}{\sqrt{\sum x_{ij}^2}}$$Weighted Normalization: Adjusts the normalized values based on user-defined importance.$$v_{ij} = w_j \cdot r_{ij}$$Ideal Solutions: Identifies the "Best Case" ($V^+$) and "Worst Case" ($V^-$) benchmarks.Distance Calculation: Calculates the Euclidean distance of each alternative from both $V^+$ and $V^-$.Closeness Coefficient: Determines the relative closeness to the ideal solution.$$S_i = \frac{D_i^-}{D_i^+ + D_i^-}$$Final Ranking: Sorts the alternatives from highest score to lowest.🔧 Error HandlingBoth tools include robust validation to prevent "garbage in, garbage out" results:File Integrity: Alerts if the file is missing or in an unsupported format.Structure Check: Ensures the file has at least 3 columns.Type Check: Detects non-numeric data in criteria columns.Logic Check: Verifies that the count of weights and impacts matches the number of criteria.Impact Validation: Ensures only + or - characters are used for impacts.🚀 Quick StartFor the Python Power User:Bashpip install pandas numpy openpyxl
